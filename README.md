# CLI-Task-Tracker
A CLI task tracker written in Python. This project is inspired by the [roadmap.sh backend project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker). It is an attempt to enhance my knowledge of backend software development. If you find this project interesting, I highly recommend checking out the original project for inspiration.
